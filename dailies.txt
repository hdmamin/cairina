X -settle on project
X -find all old relevant work
    > added 3 relevant files to this dir for now. The fourth (and perhaps most developed) effort is in the ~/nbextension-duckling dir.
~ -decide how to structure dir(s)/repo(s) (Will prob have multiple semi-related outputs, perhaps 1-5.)
    > Tentatively thinking monorepo. Easier to track everything that way.
-pick repo name
    > cairina, from "cairina moschata", one of the biggest, most powerful looking species of duck ("muscovy"). Think (rubber) duck on steroids.
X -add readme img
    > :D

-premortem
-consider whether notebook extension proj should continue or start over as jupyterlab extension
    -find stats on how commonly used each is?
-create cookiecutter template for each major project
