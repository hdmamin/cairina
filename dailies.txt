-map out very tentative plan for order to take things on (e.g. debugger -> jupyter magic -> interactive error messages -> nbextension -> reloading stuff -> LLM native programming language)
-premortem
-decide how to structure dir(s)/repo(s) (Will prob have multiple semi-related outputs, perhaps 1-5.)
-consider whether notebook extension proj should continue or start over as jupyterlab extension
    -find stats on how commonly used each is?
